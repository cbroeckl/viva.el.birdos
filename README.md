# viva.el.birdos
A repository to enable the VEB community to share code for analysis of baseball, specifically Cardinals, analysis.  For folks wanting to contribute: 

1. create a github account
2. download the github desktop software, install on your computer
3. Once in github desktop, 'clone a repository' and find cbroeckl/viva.el.birdos
    - this downloads all content to your local drive.
    - add your R code files to the existing files set
    - once you are comfortable sharing you files publicly, 'push' your code back to the repository

the idea here is that we can learn from each other.

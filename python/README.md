# Python Readme

## Setup 
This python project uses uv to manage packages. If you don't have uv installed
on your machine, you'll need to do that. On a Mac, that would be something like 
`brew install uv`. On other operating systems, you're on your own. (ie, please update
the docs accordingly)

```bash
# To set up the environemnt
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
source .venv/bin/activate
```

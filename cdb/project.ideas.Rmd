## ideas for winter projects

 - lineup run prediction.  given a lineup of nine batters, what is the run distribution expected.  Potentially incorporate statcast data, pitcher quality, defense, etc.  
 - do smaller pitchers break down more/sooner than bigger pitchers? 
 - impact of weather/elevation on pitch movement
 - small sample size predictions.  can we look at hitter behavior at an individual pitch level to predict future near-future OPS, for example? 
 - which statistics stabilize more quickly than others.  pitchers have more events per game than defenders - does %K rate stabilize at the same number of events as defensive opportunities?
